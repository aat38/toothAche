# Tooth Ache
My submission for hackathon, 'Games4SocialImpac 2019' (Third Place Winner).<br>
  ToothAche is a 2D platformer game for elementary-aged children that subtly conveys the importance of good oral hygeine. 

# A work in Progress
After demoing my game, I saw some areas that could use improvement. My plans are to make several additions:
  -A second instructional screen that indicates how and where players can navigate to the upper platforms. 
  -More explaination about plaque generation, ie: once a tooth spawns more than two plaques, it begins spawning monsters. Once a tooth      spawns three plaques without being brushed, it then succombs to decay. 
  -Turn level-difficulty into a gradient that increases with each new day
  -Create a leaderboard and have players enter their name at the begining if they want their score to be ranked (score is how many days you can survive)
  -Randomly spawn items during gameplay that can increase your health (floss, apples) or hurt your performance by spawning more plaques (candy)
